\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Acknowledgement must be made, firstly, of my supervisors, Doctor Radu Nicolescu and Associate-Professor Patrice Delmas.  Without their support and guidance, I certainly would have never made it to this point, and Doctor Nicolescu's influence in particular can be found throughout this dissertation.  So too must acknowledgement be made of Professor Emeritus Georgy Gimel'farb and Doctor Wannes van der Mark, both of whom have provided invaluable support at times.  Also, Doctor José Calderón Trilla.

Furthermore, thanks must be given to the professional staff from: the School of Computer Science; the School of Graduate Studies; Libraries and Learning Services (particularly those who served as Computer Science subject librarian); the Centre for eResearch; and the wider University of Auckland.  Particular mention must be made of Kaleigh Fennah, Emma Gavenda, Sue Skelly, Sarah Sneyd and Robyn Young.

I also would like to mention several people who were students contemporaneously with me (and in a few cases were also co-authors with me), including: Arabella Anderson; Mihailo Azhar; Daniel Britten; Doctor Trevor Gee; Alec Henderson; Yan Kolezhitskiy; Yezhou Liu; William Hsu; and Eirian Perkins.  Each of these people in some way has improved my time and experience during the PhD process.
