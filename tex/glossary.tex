% A-M
\newdefacr{cml}{CML}{Concurrent~ML}{A programming style introduced by John Reppy.  Channels}
\newdefacr{hcp}{HCP}{Hamiltonian Cycle Problem}{Closely related to the \acrlong{hcp}.  In this problem, the Hamiltonian Path must also be a cycle, i.e. it ends back at the origin node.}
\newdefacr{hpp}{HPP}{Hamiltonian Path Problem}{The problem of determining whether, for a given graph, there exists a traversal of the graph in which each node is visited exactly once.}
\newdefacr{lhs}{LHS}{Left-Hand Side}{A part of the definition of a \gls{cps} rule.  It is the list of terms which \emph{must} be present and as-yet unused in a rule at the current step, in order for the current rule to be applicable.  All terms appearing here are deleted from the containing cell at the end of the step.}

% N - Z
\newdefacr{rhs}{RHS}{Right-Hand Side}{A part of the definition of a \gls{cps} rule.  It is the list of terms which are created by the rule's application, and appear in the relevant cell at the end of the step.}
\newdefacr{sgm}{SGM}{Semi-global~Matching}{A Stereo Matching algorithm introduced by Hirschm√ºller that, as the name suggests, sits somewhere between traditional global and local Stereo Matching Algorithms.  This provides advantages in that retains much of the speed advantage of local algorithms, while also receiving much of the benefit derived from taking into consideration a larger part of the total input images.}
\newdefacr{tsp}{TSP}{Travelling Salesman Problem}{An extension of the \acrfull{hcp}.  Here, the edges between nodes have weights, and the goal of the problem is to find a minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle on the graph.}

%% A-M
\newglossaryentry{actor}{name={Actor},description={A model of message-passing-based concurrent programming originally developed  chiefly by Carl Hewitt.  Its defining characteristics are arguably that it uses asynchronous messaging, whereby the sender and receiver do not need to coordinate or synchronise at all; and that instead of using channels or similar as a go-between, Actors send messages directly to each other, which necessitates `knowing' (i.e. holding a reference to) the intended recipient.  Notable examples of implementations of Actors are found in the programming languages Erlang and Pony, and the Scala library Akka}}

\newglossaryentry{clps}{name={cell-like P~systems},description={The original \gls{ps} variant, based on the operation of chemicals in cells}}
\newglossaryentry{cps}{name={cP~systems},description={A variant of P~systems created by Nicolescu}}
\newglossaryentry{disparity}{name={disparity},description={The shift, measured as a number of pixels, of a point in one stereo image to its location in the other image.  When combined with information about the cameras derived from calibration, the measured disparity is used to estimate the distance from the cameras to the point in the scene}.  Disparity is often also referred to as `parallax'.}
\newglossaryentry{disparitymap}{name={disparity map},description={An output array/image (often just using a single channel of 8- or 16-bit integers) which encodes the final estimated disparities for every pixel in the input images.  The range of values in a disparity map itself is restricted to range of possible disparities used in the \gls{sm} algorithm.  It is common, however, to adjust the disparity map in some fashion to make differences in disparity estimates more visible through techniques such as histogram equalisation.  Most published figures of disparity maps will have had such an adjustment applied to make them more useful.  Disparity maps are sometimes also referred to as `digital parallax maps.'}}
\newglossaryentry{fne}{description={The `standard' neighbourhood arrangement in situations such as \gls{bp}.  When used in reference to a grid, it typically means the other locations in the grid immediately to the left, right, above and below.},name={four-neighbourhood}}
