\chapter{Experiments}
Explain experiments conducted and their results in here.  Does the async approach lead to improved runtimes?  Does the fact that not everything is done at the same iteration mean that \gls{bp} becomes more or less accurate for \gls{sm}?  Can probably use the Middlebury testing system to measure certain aspects of the performance in terms of the `quality' of the \gls{sm} results.  Alas, there's not enough time left to perform some sort of in-depth investigation of different \gls{bp} implementations.
