\section{Inter-\glsentrytext{tlc} messaging}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\Glspl{tlc} may exchange messages over channels (differently to the behaviour of out-symbols described in \cref{sec:cps:genericrules}).  Each \gls{tlc} may hold one or more appropriately labelled endpoints for any relevant channels, and may attempt both to send and to receive messages via those endpoints in its rules.  A message is written encapsulated inside \fxerror{May change from angle brackets}{angle brackets} and marked with either an exclamation mark on the \gls{rhs} or a question mark on the \gls{lhs} to represent sending or receiving, respectively.  E.g. \(\cpsend{\cpfunc{a}{b}}{c}\) would represent a message \(\cpfunc{a}{b}\) to be sent via channel \(c\), and \(\cprecv{\cpfunc{d}{e}}{f}\) would represent a message to be received via channel \(f\).

Both sending and receiving use pattern matching.  For the sending case, any \gls{cps} term which matches the pattern in the rule may be removed from the \gls{tlc} and placed into a buffer multiset at the other end of the channel.  Receiving works similarly in that any object stored in the channel's nearby buffer multiset, which matches the pattern of a receipt rule, may be withdrawn.  If more than one object in the buffer matches the pattern, one of them is selected non-deterministically.  Importantly, this means that ordinary \gls{cps} channels do \emph{not} operate as FIFO queues by default.

\subsection{\label{sec:cps:antiport}Antiport communication rules in \glsentrytext{cps}}
%-------------------------------------------------------

% We use an antiport rule \cite{Orellana-Martin2019,Paun2002} in \cref{sec:nmp:systemwide}.  In brief, antiport rules allow for the bidirectional exchange of objects between membranes/cells/neurons during a single rule execution, with the restriction that objects \emph{must} travel in both directions.  Thus, if one side is only ready to send or receive, rather than both, the rule cannot run at the next step.  An important ramification of this is that it prevents deadlock from both sides of the exchange waiting on the other to send a message.

% In the context of \gls{cps}, this means that a given rule must involve receipt over a channel on the left-hand-side, and sending on the \emph{same} channel on the right-hand-side.  For example, in the context of inter-\gls{tlc} messaging, \cpruleinline{ \cprule*{s_1}{\cpantirecv{\cpfunc{a}{B}}{c} \; \cpfunc{d}{E}}{1}{s_2}{\cpantisend{\cpfunc{d}{E}}{c} \; \cpfunc{a}{B}}} would be valid because the same channel is used on both sides of the rule.  To emphasise that the rule requires antiport behaviour, the sending and receiving terms have an extra ? or !, respectively.

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{anfxwarning}
A ramification of antiport communication is arguably that it completely bypasses the multisets at either end of the channel.  Whether this makes any practical difference is another story altogether.

\subsection{\label{sec:cps:blocking}Blocking vs. non-blocking message receipt in \glsentrytext{cps}}
%-------------------------------------------------------

In \gls{cps} all outgoing communications from a \gls{tlc} to others is non-blocking by default.  The channels connecting the cells buffer message objects if needed, and thus an outgoing message can always be accepted by the channel even if the holder of the other end of the channel is not yet ready to receive the message.  Receiving messages via channels is also ordinarily a non-blocking operation in \gls{cps}, albeit for a different reason.  If there are no eligible messages on the channel, either buffered by the channel itself or offered by the cell holding the other end of the channel, then the rules to receive over that channel will not apply at the next step regardless of whichever other rules may or may not be applied.

It may be helpful in some circumstances, however, to simulate the nature of a blocking receipt.  This can be achieved with the use of additional dedicated states.  The beginning state for the intended blocking receipt should be unused as the beginning state for any other rule (except for another aspect of the same blocking receipt).  This state is also used as the ending state for another rule, which either is the end of another process in the computation or used as a test to determine whether to enter into a blocking receipt.  The ending state for the blocking receipt rule should return the cell to its standard process.

The overall effect of using the unique state is that it ensures no other rule may be used inside a particular \gls{tlc} at a given step.  Effectively, the \gls{tlc} becomes quiescent until another \gls{tlc} makes an appropriate offer to send a message to the first cell.  At that point, one or more messages are exchanged as appropriate, and the receiving \gls{tlc} returns to its standard processing otherwise.  This is used in \cref{sec:nmp:pespecific} (rules 9 \& 10 in \cref{ruleset:nmp:proxspec}).
