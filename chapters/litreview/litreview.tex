\chapter{\label{chap:lr}Background and Related Work}
This review of past work focuses on the main areas of Computer Science that are relevant to this dissertation.  In none of these cases does the review come close to comprehensively covering the entire span of the given area.  It merely tries to cover as much of the relevant recent and classic work as possible, while giving an extremely brief introduction to these areas.  The interested reader who is unfamiliar with any of these topics is strongly advised to refer to the materials cited.

In particular, this \namecref{chap:lr} discusses \nameref{sec:lr:formalmodels}, \nameref{sec:lr:cml} and \nameref{sec:lr:mc}.  \Gls{mc} is, in fact, another model of concurrent computation, but given its central position in this work, it is given a dedicated separate \namecref{sec:lr:mc}.  The same can be said about \gls{cps}, which is given its own \namecref{chap:tsp}.
