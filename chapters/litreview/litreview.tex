\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\fxerror{Some of this probably should be chopped now...}{This review of related past work} focuses on the main areas of Computer Science that are relevant to this dissertation:  Formal Models of Computation (especially \gls{ps}) and \glsentrylong{cml-glossary} --- a big part of the \gls{ps} stuff is \gls{cps}, but that seemed to be big enough to merit its own chapter.  In none of these cases does the review come close to comprehensively covering the entire span of the given area.  It merely tries to cover as much of the relevant recent and classic work as possible, while giving an extremely brief introduction to these areas.  The interested reader who is unfamiliar with any of these topics is strongly advised to refer to the materials cited.
