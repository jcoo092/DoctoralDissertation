\chapter{\label{chap:tsp}The Hamiltonian Path and Travelling Salesman Problems}

% \begin{abstract}
% The Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (HCP) and Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) are long-standing and well-known NP-hard problems.  The \gls{hpp} is concerned with finding paths through a given graph such that those paths visit each node exactly once after the start, and end where they began (i.e., Hamiltonian cycles).  The TSP builds on the \gls{hpp} and is concerned with computing the lowest cost Hamiltonian cycle on a weighted (di)graph.  Many solutions to these problems exist, including some from the perspective of P~systems.  For the TSP however, almost all these papers have combined membrane computing with other approaches for approximate solution algorithms, which is surprising given the plethora of P~systems solutions to the \gls{hpp}.  A recent paper presented a brute-force style P~systems solution to the TSP with a time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\), exploiting the ability of P~systems to reduce time complexity in exchange for space complexity, but the resultant system had a fairly high number of rules, around 50.  Inspired by this paper, and seeking a more concise representation of an exact brute-force TSP algorithm, we have devised a P~systems algorithm based on cP~systems (P~systems with Complex Objects) which requires five rules and takes \(n + 3\) steps.  We first provide some background on cP~systems and demonstrate a fast new cP~systems method to find the minimum of a multiset, then describe our solution to the \gls{hpp}, and build on that for our TSP algorithm.  This paper describes said algorithms, and provides an example application of our TSP algorithm to a given graph and a digraph variant.
