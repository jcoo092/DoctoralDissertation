\section{Summary}
The use of a \gls{cml} approach to image processing was explored in this \namecref{chap:median}, in particular as applied to the \gls{medianfilter} \gls{mwt} operation.  The measured results suggest that it is much worse than using a simple, na√Øve nested \texttt{for loop}s approach.  The reason for this appears to be related primarily to overhead from the synchronous communications, especially in regard to memory allocations and garbage collections.  This may be an issue with the \gls{cml} style in general, or it may be an issue related to the \gls{cml} library used or the programming of the algorithms tested here.  More work is required to determine this for certain.  \Gls{cml} does appear to provide one advantage, however, in that with larger window sizes it seemingly has the lowest peak space requirement.

A \gls{cml} approach where a separate \gls{pe} is used to represent each pixel largely eliminates the possibility of taking advantage of data-parallel hardware, such as vector instructions of CPUs or \glspl{gpu}.  For situations where vector instructions are applicable, the \gls{cml} approach seems likely to be a poor choice.  It is not clear, however, how well this approach may or may not work for instances where the data types involved are more complex, or where there is a significant level of control flow involved.  Nor has there been any investigation so far into the practicality of assigning multiple pixels to a single \gls{pe}.
