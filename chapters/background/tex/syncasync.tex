This dissertation uses the standard timing models in distributed algorithms \cite{Lynch1996} for messaging where relevant.  For reference, the most important relevant concepts are explained and illustrated below.  For more on the topics discussed in this \lcnamecref{sec:back:syncasync}, the interested reader is referred to \cite{Fokkink2013,Lynch1996,Tel2000}.

\subsection{Rounds}
Under both synchronous and asynchronous messaging, all processes work in \emph{rounds} (sometimes also referred to as ``macro-steps'').  A round consists of three repeating sequential sub-steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{\textsc{Receive}}:  receive one or more incoming messages
    \item \emph{\textsc{Process}}:  perform any requisite local computations, and update the local state
    \item \emph{\textsc{Send}}:  send out new messages as appropriate based on the processing from the previous step
\end{enumerate}
This applies only to messaging between processes.  For systems with a solitary process, there is no meaningful difference because the process will essentially remain in the \textsc{process} sub-step.  \Ie{} a lone process will continue working without messaging until the system halts (if ever).

% As alluded to above, if there is only a single process, then it will essentially always remain in the process sub-step, until reaching a point where it stops evolving entirely.  The concept of rounds is superfluous in this situation.  Using or forgoing rounds can be a by-product of the specified \gls{ruleset}.  If there are no rules involving inter-process communication, then the process never enters the send or receive sub-steps.

\subsection{Synchronous Messaging}
Under the synchronous model, all processes proceed in lock-step.  They may carry out the sub-steps at different speeds, but begin and end rounds together.  When considering timing of messaging, there are two standard approaches:  to consider the \textsc{process} sub-step as taking one time unit and the transit time (\ie{} the time between when the message is sent by the sender and when it is received by the recipient) taking zero time units; or, to consider the \textsc{process} sub-step as taking zero time units and the transit time taking one time unit.

\subsection{Asynchronous Messaging}
Under the asynchronous model, there is (unsurprisingly) no natural synchronisation between processes.  All processes proceed through the sub-steps at their own pace.  The \textsc{process} sub-step is considered to take zero time units, and transit times are considered to take any number of time units.  Alternatively, by normalisation, while the \textsc{process} sub-step still takes zero time units, transit times take somewhere between zero and one (inclusive) time units.  This makes the second synchronous approach a special case of the asynchronous approach.  The asynchronous model is similar to the theoretical \gls{actor} model.

% \subsection{Non-determinism}
% In general, and as with \gls{mc} generally, both scenarios are non-deterministic.  This fact is most obvious in the asynchronous scenario, when messages can arrive at any arbitrary time, but even the synchronous scenario may necessitate non-deterministic choices at times.  \Eg{} when there is a choice between possible unifications, as in \cref{sec:cps:unification}; or, when there are multiple messages in a channel's bag which match the pattern of the receiving process's receipt rule but only one is to be selected,\footnote{Channels are not naturally \gls{fifo} in \gls{cps}.  See \vref{sec:cps:intertlcmess} for more.} likely because the relevant rule runs in \(\cponce\) mode.

% If complete determinism is required, it must be carefully built into the system's ruleset.  Determinism in the final result only is known as \emph{confluence}.  This means that, while different evolutions of the system may lead to different intermediate states, the final result computed will always be the same.

\subsection{Echo}
To illustrate the difference between the synchronous and asynchronous scenarios, consider the illustrations in \cref{fig:back:echosync,fig:back:echoasync}.\footnote{These figures were created by Dr. Radu Nicolescu, and have been reproduced here with his permission.}  The Echo algorithm \cite[Ch.~4.3]{Fokkink2013} is used to establish a spanning tree over a graph of nodes/processes, in this case rooted at node 1.  The algorithm works in two phases, named \emph{broadcast} and \emph{convergecast}.  Echo starts in the broadcast phase with an initiator node sending out a message to each of its neighbours.  Each of those recipients then marks the sender as its parent, and in turn sends a broadcast message to every other one of its neighbours, then waits to receive a broadcast message from each of those other neighbours.  This pattern repeats across the graph.  Once the response broadcast messages are received, each node then sends a convergecast message back to its parent.  This carries on until finally the initiator receives the convergecast messages back from its neighbours.

In \cref{fig:back:echosync,fig:back:echoasync}, the first green node is the initiator, and each other node turns green when it receives its first message.  Edges between nodes turn into green arrows when a node chooses its parent.  The direction of the arrow points to said parent.  Red arrows indicate the direction of travel for a broadcast message, while blue arrows indicate the direction of travel for a convergecast message.  Solid red \& green arrows indicate that a message is received in that round by the recipient, while a dashed line indicates that the message is still in transit.

In the synchronous case, all messages sent out are received simultaneously, and all nodes proceed through their rounds together.  In the asynchronous case, however, messages may arrive at arbitrary times, and nodes proceed through their rounds entirely independently of one another.  The ``round numbers'' in the figure mark the point where at least one message has been received by a node.  The nodes react to messages as they arrive, and might do nothing for a time while other nodes are working if no new messages arrive during that time.  Under the asynchronous model, depending on communications topology and speeds, it is possible for the first broadcast message to reach a process to have followed a less direct route from the initiator than might be possible.  Exactly this is seen in \cref{fig:back:echoasync:3}, where node 4 first receives a message from node 3 (and thus marks node 3 as its parent), despite a direct connection to the initiator, node 1.

% The asynchronous model conceptually closely matches the standard definition of asynchronicity used in distributed computing \cite{Balanescu2011,Nicolescu2014}, and \emph{not} the definition of asynchronicity followed in \cite{Cavaliere2009,Frisco2012,Song2013} and related.  This asynchronous concept differs from the synchronous one primarily in three key respects:
% \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
% \item There is \emph{no} concept of a global clock.  Each step for a given process begins after an arbitrary delay;
% \item Each step for a process takes zero time.  That is, `internal' evolution of the process is instantaneous, once the step has begun after the aforementioned delay;
% \item Messages sent between processes via channels take a random non-zero length of time to travel along the channel.
% \end{inparaenum}
