\chapter{\label{chap:back}Background}
This \lcnamecref{chap:back} summarises some pertinent related topics that are relevant to the central body of this dissertation.  Each is only a short summary, sufficient to communicate key ideas, provide necessary background information, and demonstrate that there are almost always multiple related theoretical concepts and approaches to solving problems.  In none of these cases does the synopsis come close to covering the entire span of the given area comprehensively.  Each part merely tries to introduce and illuminate its topic sufficiently for the purposes of this work.  The interested reader who is unfamiliar with any of these topics is strongly advised to refer to the materials cited.

This \lcnamecref{chap:back} specifically discusses formal models of concurrent computation, synchronous \& asynchronous communication, \gls{cml} and \gls{mc}.  \Gls{mc} is, in fact, another model of concurrent computation, but given its central position in this work, it is given a dedicated separate \lcnamecref{sec:back:mc}.  The same can be said about \gls{cps}, which is given its own \lcnamecref{chap:tsp}.
