It describes two skPsystems that model the problem and analyzes them in terms of efficiency and complexity. The skP models prove to be more succinct (in terms of number of rules, objects, number of cells and execution steps) than the corresponding tissue P system, availablein the literature, that solves the same problem, at the expense of a greater length of the rules.},

abstract = {We consider worst case time bounds for several NP-complete problems, based on a constraint satisfaction (CSP) formulation of these problems: (a,b)-CSP instances consist of a set of variables, each with up to a possible values, and constraints disallowing certain b-tuples of variable values; a problem is solved by assigning values to all variables satisfying all constraints, or by showing that no such assignment exist. 3-SAT is equivalent to (2,3)-CSP while 3-coloring and various related problems are special cases of (3,2)-CSP; there is also a natural duality transformation from (a,b)-CSP to (b,a)-CSP. We show that n-variable (3,2)-CSP instances can be solved in time O(1.3645n), that satisfying assignments to (d,2)-CSP instances can be found in randomized expected time O((0.4518d)n); that 3-coloring of n-vertex graphs can be solved in time O(1.3289n); that 3-list-coloring of n-vertex graphs can be solved in time O(1.3645n); that 3-edge-coloring of n-vertex graphs can be solved in time O(2n/2), and that 3-satisfiability of a formula with t 3-clauses can be solved in time O(nO(1)+1.3645t). {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

@book{Lewis2016,
abstract = {This book treats graph colouring as an algorithmic problem, with a strong emphasis on practical applications. The author describes and analyses some of the best-known algorithms for colouring arbitrary graphs, focusing on whether these heuristics can provide optimal solutions in some cases; how they perform on graphs where the chromatic number is unknown; and whether they can produce better solutions than other algorithms for certain types of graphs, and why. The introductory chapters explain graph colouring, and bounds and constructive algorithms. The author then shows how advanced, modern techniques can be applied to classic real-world operational research problems such as seating plans, sports scheduling, and university timetabling. He includes many examples, suggestions for further reading, and historical notes, and the book is supplemented by a website with an online suite of downloadable code. The book will be of value to researchers, graduate students, and practitioners in the areas of operations research, theoretical computer science, optimization, and computational intelligence. The reader should have elementary knowledge of sets, matrices, and enumerative combinatorics.},

In this paper, we study the power of these systems in the case of eight restricted variants of communication rules. We show that seven of these restrictions lead to computational completeness, while using the remaining one the systems are able to compute only finite singletons of non-negative integers. The obtained results complete the investigations of the computational power of generalized communicating P systems and provide further examples for simple architectures with simple functioning rules which are as powerful as Turing machines. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Song2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2002-2011 IEEE. Tissue P systems with channel states are a class of bio-inspired parallel computational models, where rules are used in a sequential manner (on each channel, at most one rule can be used at each step). In this work, tissue P systems with channel states working in a flat maximally parallel way are considered, where at each step, on each channel, a maximal set of applicable rules that pass from a given state to a unique next state, is chosen and each rule in the set is applied once. The computational power of such P systems is investigated. Specifically, it is proved that tissue P systems with channel states and antiport rules of length two are able to compute Parikh sets of finite languages, and such P systems with one cell and noncooperative symport rules can compute at least all Parikh sets of matrix languages. Some Turing universality results are also provided. Moreover, the NP-complete problem SAT is solved by tissue P systems with channel states, cell division and noncooperative symport rules working in the flat maximally parallel way; nevertheless, if channel states are not used, then such P systems working in the flat maximally parallel way can solve only tractable problems. These results show that channel states provide a frontier of tractability between efficiency and non-efficiency in the framework of tissue P systems with cell division (assuming P = NP).},

@book{Ben-Ari2008,
abstract = {The Spin model checker is a widely used professional software tool for specifying and verifying concurrent and distributed systems. Models, written in a simple language called Promela, can be simulated randomly or interactively. Spin can generate efficient verifiers that search for a counterexample to correctness specifications applied to a model. Spin is also a superb tool for teaching important concepts of computer science such as verification, concurrency and nondeterminism. The Promela language is easy to learn, as is the linear temporal logic used for correctness specifications, and the techniques for simulating and verifying models. Principles of Spin is an introductory book for students and practicing software engineers who wish to learn Promela and Spin. The presentation starts with the verification of sequential programs and proceeds in gradual stages to the verification of concurrent and then distributed programs. Complete programs are used to demonstrate each construct and concept, and the source code of these programs, together with that of longer case studies, are available on the companion website. The book describes free software that the author has developed: jSpin—an integrated development environment for Spin, SpinSpider—a visualization tool that automatically constructs graphical state diagrams of concurrent programs, and VN—a Spin-based tool for visualizing nondeterminism of finite automata.},
