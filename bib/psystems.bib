abstract = {Part of the broader research field of natural computing, Membrane Computing is an area within computing science that aims to abstract computing ideas and models from the structure and functioning of living cells, as well as from the way the cells are organized in tissues or higher order structures. It studies models of computation (known as P systems) inspired by the biochemistry of cells, in particular by the role of membranes in the compartmentalization of living cells into "protected reactors". This handbook provides both a comprehensive survey of available knowledge and established research topics, and a guide to recent developments in the field, covering the subject from theory to applications. The handbook is suitable both for introducing novices to this area of research, and as a main source of reference for active researchers. It sets out the necessary biological and formal background, with the introductory chapter serving as a gentle introduction to and overview of membrane computing. Individual chapters, written by leading researchers in membrane computing, present the state of the art of all main research trends and include extensive bibliographies.},

abstract = {We overview the current state of cP systems and illustrate it with a series of old and new examples, intentionally simple, but fundamental in their areas. cP systems -- i.e. P systems with compound terms -- share the fundamental features of traditional cell-like (tree-based) and tissue (graph-based) P systems: unlimited space and computing power, cells, nested cells, multisets, messages, rewriting rules, possibly running in maximal parallel modes. In contrast to traditional P systems, inner nested cells do not have their own rulesets. However, this restriction is usually more than compensated by their significant extensions: compound Prolog-like terms, high-level rules, control on incoming messages. Additionally, the same rulesets can run in either synchronous or asynchronous mode, without any syntactic change. cP systems have been successfully used to model quite a few fundamental and real-life problems, e.g. in NP complexity, data structures, graph theory, distributed algorithms, image processing. As trademark, cP models use fixed sized alphabets and crisp rulesets, independent of the problem size. The samples cover a wide variety of areas, such as arithmetic, list structures, summary statistics and sorting, asynchronous communications, {\$}{\$}$\backslash$mu {\$}{\$}{\$}\mu{\$}-recursive functions.},

abstract = {? Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.This paper presents a membrane algorithm, called MAQIS, by appropriately combining concepts and principles of membrane computing and quantum-inspired evolutionary approach. MAQIS has four distinct features from the membrane algorithms reported in the literature: initial solutions are only inside the skin membrane; different regions separated by membranes have different components of the algorithm; all the components inside membranes cooperate to produce offspring in a single evolutionary generation; communication rules are performed in a single evolutionary step. Extensive experiments conducted on knapsack problems show that MAQIS outperforms five counterpart approaches and our previous work. The effectiveness of MAQIS is also verified in the application of image processing.},

@article{Martin-Vide2003,
abstract = {Starting from the way the inter-cellular communication takes place by means of protein channels (and also from the standard knowledge about neuron functioning), we propose a computing model called a tissue P system, which processes symbols in a multiset rewriting sense, in a net of cells. Each cell has a finite state memory, processes multisets of symbol-impulses, and can send impulses ("excitations") to the neighboring cells. Such cell nets are shown to be rather powerful: they can simulate a Turing machine even when using a small number of cells, each of them having a small number of states. Moreover, in the case when each cell works in the maximal manner and it can excite all the cells to which it can send impulses, then one can easily solve the Hamiltonian Path Problem in linear time. A new characterization of the Parikh images of ET0L languages is also obtained in this framework. Besides such basic results, the paper provides a series of suggestions for further research. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Various variants were already shown to be computationally universal, equal in power to Turing machines. In this paper one proposes a class of P systems whose membranes are the main active components, in the sense that they directly mediate the evolution and the communication of objects. Moreover, the membranes can multiply themselves by division.

abstract = {This paper proposes a way to incorporate the idea of spiking neurons into the area of membrane computing, and to this aim we introduce a class of neural-like P systems which we call spiking neural P systems (in short, SN P systems). In these devices, the time (when the neurons fire and/or spike) plays an essential role. For instance, the result of a computation is the time between the moments when a specified neuron spikes. Seen as number computing devices, SN P systems are shown to be computationally complete (both in the generating and accepting modes, in the latter case also when restricting to deterministic systems). If the number of spikes present in the system is bounded, then the power of SN P systems falls drastically, and we get a characterization of semilinear sets. A series of research topics and open problems are formulated.},

We assess these capabilities by attempting a revised version of our previously best solution for the Byzantine agreement problem – a famous problem in distributed algorithms, with non-trivial data structures and algorithms. In contrast to our previous solutions, which use a greater than exponential number of symbols and rules, the new solution uses a fixed sized alphabet and ruleset, independent of the problem size. The new ruleset follows closely the conceptual description of the algorithm. This revised framework opens the way to further extensions, which may bring P systems closer to the conceptual Actor model.},

Given enough cells, the P system implementation speeds up the inner algorithm loop from O(nd) to O(n+d), where n is the width of a stereo image and d is the disparity range. The implementation gives also an insight into a more general SDPS that accounts for a possible multiplicity of solutions of the ill-posed problem of optimal stereo matching.},

In general, the image B is a skeleton of the black and white image A, if the image B is made of fewer black pixels than the image A, it does preserve its topological properties and, in some sense, keeps its meaning.

abstract = {We propose a novel approach to justify and guide regularisation of an ill-posed one-dimensional global optimisation with multiple solutions using a massively parallel (P system) model of the solution space. Classical optimisation assumes a well-posed problem with a stable unique solution. Most of important practical problems are ill posed due to an unstable or non-unique global optimum and are regularised to get a unique best-suited solution. Whilst regularisation theory exists largely for unstable unique solutions, its recommendations are often routinely applied to inverse optical problems with essentially non-unique solutions, e.g. computer stereo vision or image segmentation, typically formulated in terms of global energy minimisation. In these cases the recommended regularisation becomes purely heuristic and does not guarantee a unique solution. As a result, classical optimisation algorithms: dynamic programming (DP) and belief propagation (BP) - meet with difficulties. Our recent concurrent propagation (CP), leaning upon the P systems paradigm, extends DP and BP to always detect whether the problem is ill posed or not and store in the ill-posed case an entire space of solutions that yield the same global optimum. This suggests a radically new path to proper regularisation: select the best-suited unique solution by exploring statistical and structural features of this space. We propose a P systems based implementation of CP and set out as a case study an application of CP to the image matching problem in stereo vision.},

Nowadays, we are witnessing the consolidation of the GPUs as a parallel framework to compute general purpose applications. In this paper, we analyse GPUs as an alternative parallel architecture to improve the performance in the simulation of P systems, and we illustrate it by using the case study of a family of P systems that provides an efficient and uniform solution to the SAT problem. Firstly, we develop a simulator that fully simulates the computation of the P system, demonstrating that GPUs are well suited to simulate them. Then, we adapt this simulator to the GPU architecture idiosyncrasies, improving the performance of the previous simulator. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The number of active threads was low if the number of objects inside a membrane was low. This study represents objects of membranes as entities of a matrix. Then a sub-matrix represents the appropriate number of objects assigned to threads of each thread block to balance the load and keep the occupancy high even when the number of objects per membrane is low. The size of the sub-matrix or the appropriate number of active threads is determined automatically. Furthermore, by this approach it is possible to assign more than one membrane to each thread block and to execute communication between membranes in the same thread block without the need for time-consuming inter-block communication. For example, using the previous algorithm, for two objects per membrane the speed up is 0.6×, while for the proposed algorithm the speed up is 32.4×.},

Two new algorithms have been proposed for simulating membrane systems models on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Communication and synchronization between threads and thread blocks in a GPU are time-consuming processes. In previous studies, dependent objects were assigned to different threads. This increases the need for communication between threads, and as a result, performance decreases. In previous studies, dependent membranes have also been assigned to different thread blocks, requiring inter-block communications and decreasing performance. The speedup of the proposed algorithm on a GPU that classifies dependent objects using a sequential approach, for example with 512 objects per membrane, was 82×, while for the previous approach (Algorithm 1), it was 8.2×. For a membrane system with high dependency among membranes, the speedup of the second proposed algorithm (Algorithm 3) was 12×, while for the previous approach (Algorithm 1) and the first proposed algorithm (Algorithm 2) that assign each membrane to one thread block, it was 1.8×. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The first chapter of the book includes formulas for energy, static and dynamic power, integrated circuit costs, reliability, and availability. Chapter 2 discusses memory hierarchy and includes discussions about virtual machines, SRAM and DRAM technologies, and new material on Flash memory. The third chapter covers the exploitation of instruction-level parallelism in high-performance processors, superscalar execution, dynamic scheduling and multithreading, followed by an introduction to vector architectures in the fourth chapter.

abstract = {Innovations in hardware architecture, like hyper-threading or multicore processors, mean that parallel computing resources are available for inexpensive desktop computers. In only a few years, many standard software products will be based on concepts of parallel programming implemented on such hardware, and the range of applications will be much broader than that of scientific computing, up to now the main application area for parallel computing. Rauber and R{\"{u}}nger take up these recent developments in processor architecture by giving detailed descriptions of parallel programming techniques that are necessary for developing efficient programs for multicore processors as well as for parallel cluster systems and supercomputers. Their book is structured in three main parts, covering all areas of parallel computing: the architecture of parallel systems, parallel programming models and environments, and the implementation of efficient application algorithms. The emphasis lies on parallel programming techniques needed for different architectures. The main goal of the book is to present parallel programming techniques that can be used in many situations for many application areas and which enable the reader to develop correct and efficient parallel programs. Many examples and exercises are provided to show how to apply the techniques. The book can be used as both a textbook for students and a reference book for professionals. The presented material has been used for courses in parallel programming at different universities for many years. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010. All rights are reserved.},

However, these problems are typically in NP rather than higher in the polynomial time hierarchy. In this paper, we solve QSAT (also known as TQBF), which is a well-known PSPACE-complete problem. Compared to other extant confluent P systems solutions, our deterministic cP solution only uses a small constant number of custom alphabet symbols (19), a small constant number of rules (10) and a small constant upper limit of membrane nesting depth (6), independent of the problem size.},

The model is parallel, nondeterministic. Many variants have already been considered and many problems about them were investigated. We present here some of these variants, focusing on two central classes of results: (1) characterizations of the recursively enumerable sets of numbers and (2) possibilities to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial - even linear - time (of course, by making use of an exponential space).

abstract = {Spiking Neural P systems (in short, SNP systems) are computing models based on living neurons. SNP systems are non-deterministic and parallel, hence making use of a parallel processor such as a graphics processing unit (in short, GPU) is a natural candidate for simulations. Matrix representations and algorithms were previously developed for simulating SNP systems. In this work, our two results extend previous works in simulating SNP systems in the GPU: (a) the number of neurons the simulator can handle is now arbitrary; (b) SNP systems are now represented in a dense instead of sparse way. The impact in terms of time and space of these extensions to the GPU simulator are analysed. As expected, SNP systems with more neurons need more simulation time, although the simulator performance can scale (i.e. perform better) with larger GPUs. The dense representation helps in the simulation of larger systems.},

abstract = {Spiking neural P systems (SN P systems, for short) are a class of distributed parallel computing devices inspired from the way neurons communicate by means of spikes. In this work, a discrete structure representation of SN P systems with extended rules and without delay is proposed. Specifically, matrices are used to represent SN P systems. In order to represent the computations of SN P systems by matrices, configuration vectors are defined to monitor the number of spikes in each neuron at any given configuration; transition net gain vectors are also introduced to quantify the total amount of spikes consumed and produced after the chosen rules are applied. Nondeterminism of the systems is assured by a set of spiking transition vectors that could be used at any given time during the computation. With such matrix representation, it is quite convenient to determine the next configuration from a given configuration, since it involves only multiplication and addition of matrices after deciding the spiking transition vector.},

@article{Martinez-del-Amor2021,
abstract = {To date, parallel simulation algorithms for spiking neural P (SNP) systems are based on a matrix representation. This way, the simulation is implemented with linear algebra operations, which can be easily parallelized on high performance computing platforms such as GPUs. Although it has been convenient for the first generation of GPU-based simulators, such as CuSNP, there are some bottlenecks to sort out. For example, the proposed matrix representations of SNP systems lead to very sparse matrices, where the majority of values are zero. It is known that sparse matrices can compromise the performance of algorithms since they involve a waste of memory and time. This problem has been extensively studied in the literature of parallel computing. In this paper, we analyze some of these ideas and apply them to represent some variants of SNP systems. We also provide a new simulation algorithm based on a novel compressed representation for sparse matrices. We also conclude which SNP system variant better suits our new compressed matrix representation.},

@article{Freund2005,
abstract = {The original model of P systems with symbol objects introduced by P{\u{a}}un was shown to be computationally universal, provided that catalysts and priorities of rules are used. By reduction via register machines Sos{\'{i}}k and Freund proved that the priorities may be omitted from the model without loss of computational power. Freund, Oswald, and Sos{\'{i}}k considered several variants of P systems with catalysts (but without priorities) and investigated the number of catalysts needed for these specific variants to be computationally universal. It was shown that for the classic model of P systems with the minimal number of two membranes the number of catalysts can be reduced from six to five; using the idea of final states the number of catalysts could even be reduced to four. In this paper we are able to reduce the number of catalysts again: two catalysts are already sufficient. For extended P systems we even need only one membrane and two catalysts. For the (purely) catalytic systems considered by Ibarra only three catalysts are already enough. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Image edge detection is a fundamental problem in image processing and computer vision, particularly in the area of feature extraction. However, the time complexity increases squarely with the increase of image resolution in conventional serial computing mode. This results in being unbearably time consuming when dealing with a large amount of image data. In this paper, a novel resolution free parallel implementation algorithm for gradient based edge detection, namely EDENP, is proposed. The key point of our method is the introduction of an enzymatic numerical P system (ENPS) to design the parallel computing algorithm for image processing for the first time. The proposed algorithm is based on a cell-like P system with a nested membrane structure containing four membranes. The start and stop of the system is controlled by the variables in the skin membrane. The calculation of edge detection is performed in the inner three membranes in a parallel way. The performance and efficiency of this algorithm are evaluated on the CUDA platform. The main advantage of EDENP is that the time complexity of O(1) can be achieved regardless of image resolution theoretically.},

P Systems are the computing devices that are used to realize membrane computing models. Numerous theoretical studies on many variants of P Systems have shown them to be computationally universal. There is a wide range of applications of P Systems from modeling of biological processes to image processing. Among many variants of P Systems, one of the most important is Enzymatic Numerical P System (ENPS). ENPS is a class of P System in which membranes operate on numerical values. To realize the power of ENPS there are a few simulators developed. Each and every simulator has some advantages as well as some disadvantages. Here, a GPU based simulator using Python as a user interaction language is developed. This tool is a completely parallel variant, compatible with a Python based sequential simulator (PeP) which was the first Python based work for ENPS. The developed simulator uses CUDA to interact with GPU and gives the desired speed up, while processing the membranes. There are two important case studies which show the performance of the developed tool to be far better than the other serial simulators.},

Some of these simulators are relatively generic, providing enough flexibility for a wide variety of models and others are ad-hoc simulators that reproduce computations of a single design that has been hard-coded or computations of a single type of model. On the one hand, generic tools are excellent assistants for the researchers while verifying their designs. On the other hand, the efficiency of specific tools in terms of simulation performance for a given design sacrifices the flexibility of the previous ones. In this paper, it is presented for the first time a tool that breaks this duality, we have implemented a compiler which receives as input the definition of a design in the P-Lingua language and produces as output source code in the C++ language for an ad-hoc simulator that has been optimized for the input design. The objective of this work is twofold: On the one hand, we have extended the P-Lingua framework to include some semantic features concerning to the models, such as rule patterns and derivation modes, that can be written in an explicit manner within their own file. On the other hand, we have developed a GNU GPLv3 command-line tool for Linux which works in the same manner as conventional compilers.

@article{Perez-Hurtado2019,
abstract = {Membrane computing is a bio-inspired computing paradigm that lacks in vivo implementation. That is why software or hardware implementations have to be used to validate models. Several tools have been created for this purpose; some of them are created for specific purposes, such as solving a computationally hard problem; and others are more generic, to cover a broad spectrum of possible models. The former have the advantage of being very efficient, crucial for solving large instances of certain problems; however, this efficiency leads to a loss of generality, since algorithms are usually hard-coded and they do not allow other models. On the contrary, the latter are perfect tools for researchers, given that new models can be checked without much effort by defining them in the framework; since these algorithms have to simulate as many models as possible, they lack specificities to improve the performance. P-Lingua has been widely used to simulate membrane systems, having integrated both a language and a simulator. To obtain better results in terms of time used to simulate models defined in this language, a new perspective is studied. The model defined in P-Lingua will be compiled into C++ source code that will implement an ad hoc simulator. This code will consider specifications about how rules have to be executed, that is, some simple specifications of the semantics. To show how it works, some examples of specifications of models will be presented, which can be simulated using the new-developed GNU GPLv3 command-line tool pcc.},
